Automation in DevOps refers to scripting repetitive tasks like provisioning, configuration, deployment, and monitoring to improve efficiency and reduce errors.  

### **2. What are the benefits of scripting in DevOps?**  

- Reduces manual effort  
- Increases consistency and repeatability  
- Improves efficiency and speed
